Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
  and represent it visually.

Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
  work to make more profit.
  
● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism (Level - Intermediate)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

Task-5 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports (Level - Advanced)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’

● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors
  contributing win or loss of a team.
  
● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.

Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
  predict the right class accordingly.
